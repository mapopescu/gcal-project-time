# gcal-project-time
Google Calendar based timesheet

Use your Google Calendar to note time spent on different projects, then take a look at each week and get daily time spent on each project.
Easy to use: just add events in your calendar using "project - task" and the tool will add up all tasks spent the same day on the same project.
